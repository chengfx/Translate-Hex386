#Introduction
This repository is created to hold the codes which are built to extract data from the Hex383 file. Hex386 is the format of file which holds the memory data in embeded systems. If you can read chinese, you could ask for helps from my Blog [stm32调试 -- 获取内存数据][1] to know what the Hex386 format is. Or you could search for answers by [Google][2]. Anyway, this is just a program I write for the convenience in work.
